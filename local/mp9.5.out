INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

  TITLE:	this is an example of two-level path
  analysis with continuous dependent
  variables and random slopes
  DATA:	FILE IS mp9.5.dat;
  VARIABLE:	NAMES ARE y1 y2 x1 clus;
  WITHIN = x1 ;
  CLUSTER IS clus;
  ANALYSIS:	TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
  ALGORITHM = INTEGRATION;
  MODEL:
    %WITHIN%
    s2 | y2 ON y1 x1;
         y1 ON x1;
  %BETWEEN%
    y2 ON y1 x1;
    y1 ON x1;

  OUTPUT:	TECH1 TECH8;

*** WARNING in MODEL command
  In the MODEL command, the predictor variable on the WITHIN level refers to the whole
  observed variable in the statement:  S2 | Y2 ON Y1
  To use the latent within-level part, use ESTIMATOR=BAYES in the ANALYSIS command.
*** ERROR in MODEL command
  Observed variable on the right-hand side of a between-level ON statement must be a BETWEEN
  variable when using ML estimators.  The BAYES estimator may resolve this problem.
  Problem with:  Y1
*** ERROR in MODEL command
  Within-level variables cannot be used on the between level.
  Within-level variable used:  X1
*** ERROR in MODEL command
  Within-level variables cannot be used on the between level.
  Within-level variable used:  X1
*** ERROR
  The following MODEL statements are ignored:
  * Statements in the BETWEEN level:
    Y2 ON Y1
    Y2 ON X1
    Y1 ON X1

Mplus VERSION 8.2 DEMO (Linux) has the following limitations:
  Maximum number of dependent variables: 6
  Maximum number of independent variables: 2
  Maximum number of between variables: 2
  Maximum number of continuous latent variables in time series analysis: 2
